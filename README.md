# LyricScraper
Python program to scrape lyrics using the STANDS4 Web services API and Selenium Web automation Webdriver
For your personal use, it is recommended that you follow the  Selenium documentation for setting up the 
WebDriver. Make sure to download the version of the webdriver that matches your current broweser version

My method is shown here: <br />

You may also have to configure your project and create a new virtual environment(venv) when you want to run this script. I used pyCharm to do it so it was easily done.

Thanks for checking out my cool little script! Here's a Demo of how the script should work once you've run it<br />
